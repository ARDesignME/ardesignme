### INSTALLATION
For instructions on installing modules to Drupal 8, see https://docs.acquia.com/article/how-install-drupal-8-module

**1.** Install Fresco

**2.** Optional: Install IMCE (https://www.drupal.org/project/imce)


### Configuration
Fresco is configurable on the block level. You may:
- Upload an image via Drupal's core upload tool
- Use an image already uploaded though the IMCE interface (IMCE required)
- Define a class, alt text, role, and aria-label for the image

### Purpose
Developed for Panels usage, because sometimes you just want THAT f'in image without cluttering with content types
